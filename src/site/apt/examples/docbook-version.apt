Specific DocBook Version

    The version of DocBook to use is itself defined as dependency.  By default,
    the version defined by the <jDocBook Plugin> is used, so that would depend
    on the version of the <jDocBook Plugin> used.

    It is however, possible to override that and say to use another version of
    DocBook instead, simply by defining the new version as a dependency.
