Project Local Style

    As discussed {{{../style.html}here}}, a jdocbook project may provide custom
    style elements.  Currently this is limited to images and css.  These are
    controlled by the <<imageResource>> and <<cssResource>> parameters.  For example,
    a common approach to developing DocBook-based documentation is to keep the
    source and images in the same relative directory:

+----+
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.jboss.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifacId>maven-jdocbook-plugin</artifactId>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <sourceDirectory>src/main/docs</sourceDirectory>
        <sourceDocumentName>my-doc.xml</sourceDocumentName>
        <imageResource>
            <directory>src/main/docs</directory>
            <includes>
                <include>**/*.png</include>
                <include>**/*.svg</include>
                <include>**/*.gif</include>
            </includes>
        </imageResource>
        ...
    </configuration>
</plugin>
