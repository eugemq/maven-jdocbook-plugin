Internationalization

    In support of internationalization (i18n) and locationization (l10n) efforts, the <jDocBook Plugin> allows you
    to develop and manage language-specific versions of your documentation.  Currently this support is achieved via
    the GNU {{{http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/}gettext}} package, which aims to help developers and translators by
    providing a series of tools to make localizing content easier.  In this iteration, the <jDocBook Plugin> relies on
    the host system having the following executables available on their system/path and makes use of system
    RuntimeEnvironment calls to execute them:

        [[1]] msginit and msgmerge - these come from the <gettext> package itself (see link above)

        [[2]] xml2pot and po2xml - which come from the KDE poxml package (

        []

    It is expected that there will be a java port of these tools at some point, and that the <jDocBook Plugin> would
    then be updated to use those ports.  However, such an effort is large and not expected anytime soon.
