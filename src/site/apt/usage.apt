Usage

    To understand usage of the <jDocBook Plugin>, there are really a few concepts
    you must understand.

    [[1]] {{{formats.apt}Formats}} define the type of output(s) you wish to produce.

    [[2]] {{{style.apt}Styles}} define how those format outputs should look.

    []

    If you want to use local style elements, it is also a good idea to understand
    {{{staging.html}staging}} as well.

* Minimal configuration

    The most basic configuration of the <jDocBook Plugin> is to simply tell it:

    [[1]] The DocBook soure file to be transformed

    [[2]] The formats into which the source should be transformed.

    []

    Here is a minimal configuration defining PDF and HTML output formats, for a
    source file named source.xml:

+----+
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.jboss.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-jdocbook-plugin</artifactId>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <sourceDocumentName>source.xml</sourceDocumentName>
        <formats>
            <format>
                <formatName>pdf</formatName>
            </format>
            <format>
                <formatName>html</formatName>
            </format>
        </formats>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
